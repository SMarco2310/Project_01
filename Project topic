So this project is all about testing what i can do when I decide to challenge my self.

For instance there is no clear topic I would like to work on but as I progress I might
start cooking something here.

### Create an Interface for the shuttle System 

# I will be using java as Back-end for the application

# Design an interface for the app
- so the app should have a welcome page 
- a sign up page
- a login page
- a user profile page
- a user Menu / Student as Driver

- and more...
